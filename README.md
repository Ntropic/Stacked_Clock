# Stacked_Clock
An animated analog clock with the fingers stacked on top of one another, resulting in a beautiful path drawn out over the course of the day. For full hours, the fingers (hour, minute and second) point outward. More precisely, the minute and hour fingers point in the same direction, when an hour is full and the minute finger points inwards towards the center every half an hour. Similarly the second finger points in the same direction as the minute finger for full minutes and inwards towards the tip of the hour finger at every half minute. 

There are two .html programs in the repository, one that reacts to the presence of the mouse *modular_clock_mouse_movement.html* and one that does not *modular_clock_no_mouse_movement.html*. Some previews can be seen below
